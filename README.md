A simple website I created as a project in my Introduction to Website Development class at New Jersey Institute of Technology in the Fall 2022 semester. 
This website informs users about the history of the world-famous boy band "BTS." 
The goal was to create a website based on my interest. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap was used.
